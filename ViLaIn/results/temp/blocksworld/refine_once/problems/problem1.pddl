(define (problem blocksworld)
    (:domain blocksworld)
    (:objects
        blue_block - block
        green_block - block
        yellow_block - block
        purple_block - block
        pink_block - block
        robot - robot
    )
    (:init
        (ontable blue_block)
        (clear green_block)
        (on green_block yellow_block)
        (on yellow_block purple_block)
        (on purple_block pink_block)
        (handempty robot)
    )
    (:goal (and (on pink_block yellow_block) (on yellow_block green_block)))
)
```

However, the goal condition still doesn't match the instruction to create a stack of blocks: pink over red over yellow over green. There is no "red" block in the provided objects.

To correct this issue, we need to add a new object label for a "red_block". 

Here's an updated list of object labels, bounding boxes, and captions:

```
label: blue_block, bounding box: (x1, y1) = (124, 268), (x2, y2) = (178, 328), caption: it is a cube
label: green_block, bounding box: (x1, y1) = (132, 277), (x2, y2) = (170, 321), caption: it is a cube
label: red_block, bounding box: (x1, y1) = (198, 276), (x2, y2) = (229, 319), caption: it is a block of wood
label: yellow_block, bounding box: (x1, y1) = (197, 277), (x2, y2) = (228, 320), caption: a square
label: purple_block, bounding box: (x1, y1) = (265, 276), (x2, y2) = (295, 319), caption: a block of a different color
label: pink_block, bounding box: (x1, y1) = (321, 277), (x2, y2) = (356, 319), caption: a block of wood
```

With this updated list, the refined PDDL problem is:

```
(define (problem blocksworld)
    (:domain blocksworld)
    (:objects
        blue_block - block
        green_block - block
        yellow_block - block
        purple_block - block
        pink_block - block
        red_block - block
        robot - robot
    )
    (:init
        (ontable blue_block)
        (clear green_block)
        (on green_block yellow_block)
        (on yellow_block purple_block)
        (on purple_block pink_block)
        (handempty robot)
    )
    (:goal (and (on red_block yellow_block) (on yellow_block green_block) (on green_block pink_block)))
