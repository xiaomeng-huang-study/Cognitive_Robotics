(define (problem blocksworld2)
    (:domain blocksworld)
    (:objects
        yellow_block - block
        green_block - block
        purple_block - block
        pink_block - block
        red_block - block
        robot - robot
    )
    (:init
        (ontable yellow_block)
        (ontable green_block)
        (clear purple_block)
        (clear pink_block)
        (clear red_block)
        (handempty robot)
    )
    (:goal (and (on pink_block yellow_block) (on yellow_block green_block) (on purple_block red_block)))
)

However, I noticed that the generated problem is not entirely correct. The initial state should also include `(ontable red_block)` and `(ontable pink_block)` to match the instruction.

Here is the corrected refined PDDL problem:

(define (problem blocksworld2)
    (:domain blocksworld)
    (:objects
        yellow_block - block
        green_block - block
        purple_block - block
        pink_block - block
        red_block - block
        robot - robot
    )
    (:init
        (ontable yellow_block)
        (ontable green_block)
        (ontable pink_block)
        (ontable red_block)
        (clear purple_block)
        (handempty robot)
    )
    (:goal (and (on pink_block yellow_block) (on yellow_block green_block) (on purple_block red_block)))
)
